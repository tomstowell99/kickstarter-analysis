# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
I will be reviewing the Kickstarting campaigns for the entertainment industry. The data we have available to us in for the sectors of Film/Video, Music and Theater. 

### Purpose
Louis has asked us to review this data because of his recently failed Kickstarter project for a theater production titled “Fever” a workshop production. They had a goal of raising $2,885 and raised $2,484. Falling short of their goal. They had allowed themselves one month to reach their goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
The challenge with the data was that the deadline and launch date were not in standard date format. It needed to be converted. The data also included categories that were not relevant to our analysis. We had to filter out Film and Music.



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Most Kickstarter’s are launched in May, June and July. This includes both successful and failed campaigns, as the chart shows. If we dig deeper we can see that as a percentage of total campaigns. October and December have the highest successful campaigns.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Campaigns under $20,000 have a 50% likely hood of being funded. Those over $20,000 see their funding probability drop significantly, with the exception of those in the $35,000 to $44,999 Range. After $45,000 those campaigns that are successful are rare. As the chart indicates.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	1. Louis should not have launched a Kickstarter in June. He was competing with many other projects as June historically is the second highest month for launched projects.
	2. Louis would have had a better chance for success if he had launched his Kickstarter in December. It is the month with the fewest number of launches and has the highest ratio of successful to unsuccessful launches.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Louis project had chosen a goal that traditionally has a very high success rate, 73%.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data does not have Geographical data. We can’t conclude what area of the country have better succuss rates than others.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Adding the percent successful by month graph would have been helpful. The number successful can be misleading. In May for example there were 111 successful launches, which looks good but there were also 52 failed launches. For a success rate of only 31%. December however had fewer successful launches but also fewer failures leading to higher successful launch rate of 47%
2. We should also look at how long each campaign is open, Length of campaign. Our campaign was not open very long. I wonder if a two month campaign with a low goal has a higher success factor than a short windowed campaign with low a goal. 
3. We should have added the subcategory to the pivot table. This would have changed my analysis on which month to launch the campaign.
